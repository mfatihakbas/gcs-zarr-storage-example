‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note on AWS Credentials

For security reasons, this project does not include any AWS Access Key or Secret Key directly in the codebase.
All AWS interactions are done using credentials securely configured through the AWS CLI.

Each user is expected to:
- Configure their own credentials using `aws configure`
- Use their own S3 bucket for testing
- ‚ùå Never share access keys in public repositories

If you do not have credentials yet, please follow the "Amazon S3 Setup" instructions in the README to:
- Create an IAM user
- Attach the required S3 permissions (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess)
- Generate your own Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

üîê Reminder: This script assumes AWS CLI is already configured using your personal credentials.
This script does not handle key files or manual secret access in code.
